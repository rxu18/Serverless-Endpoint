# College Ranker
This is a ranking of all the college in the world, as seen by a Harvard student.

## Installation
First, you need to have chalice installed. You can do this with pip:
```
pip install chalice
```
I'd recommend working in a virtualenv.

Next, run
```
chalice deploy
```
which should provide you with a REST API link. Open up the link and you'll be directed to the index page. Then, change the index to */college/YOUR-CHOICE-OF-COLLEGE*.
